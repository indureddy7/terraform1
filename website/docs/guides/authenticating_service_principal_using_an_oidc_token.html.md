# Azure DevOps Provider: Authenticating to a Service Principal with an OIDC Token

The Azure DevOps provider supports service principals through a variety of authentication methods, including workload identity federation from any OIDC compliant token issuer.

## Service Principal Configuration

1. Create a service principal in [Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) or
using [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell). Ignore steps about application roles and certificates.

2. [Configure your app registration to trust your identity provider.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#other-identity-providers)

3. [Add the service principal to your Azure DevOps Organization.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/service-principal-managed-identity?view=azure-devops#2-add-and-manage-service-principal-in-an-azure-devops-organization)

## Provider Configuration

The `use_oidc` must be set to `true` to use OIDC token.

The provider will need the Directory (tenant) ID and the Application (client) ID from the Azure AD app registration. They may be provided via the `ARM_TENANT_ID` and `ARM_CLIENT_ID` environment variables, or in the provider configuration block with the `tenant_id` and `client_id` attributes.

The token may be provided as a base64 encoded string, or by a file on the filesystem with the `ARM_OIDC_TOKEN` or `ARM_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE_PATH` environment variables, or in the provider configuration block with the `oidc_token` or `oidc_token_file_path` attributes.

When running Terraform in GitHub Actions, the provider will detect the `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` and `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN` environment variables set by the GitHub Actions runtime. You can also specify the `ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_TOKEN` and `ARM_OIDC_REQUEST_URL` environment variables.

For GitHub Actions workflows, you'll need to ensure the workflow has `write` permissions for the `id-token`.

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
```

For more information about OIDC in GitHub Actions, see [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-cloud-providers).

### Providing the token through the file system

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azuredevops = {
      source  = "microsoft/azuredevops"
      version = ">=0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azuredevops" {
  org_service_url = "https://dev.azure.com/my-org"
  client_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  tenant_id            = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  oidc_token_file_path = "C:\\my_oidc_token.txt"
  use_oidc             = true
}

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name        = "Test Project"
  description = "Test Project Description"
}
```

### Providing the token directly as a string

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azuredevops = {
      source  = "microsoft/azuredevops"
      version = ">=0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azuredevops" {
  org_service_url = "https://dev.azure.com/my-org"
  client_id  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  tenant_id  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  oidc_token = "top-secret-base64-encoded-oidc-token-string"
  use_oidc   = true
}

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name        = "Test Project"
  description = "Test Project Description"
}
```


### Configure the provider to authenticate with the Terraform Cloud workload identity token

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azuredevops = {
      source  = "microsoft/azuredevops"
      version = ">=0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azuredevops" {
  org_service_url = "https://dev.azure.com/my-org"
  client_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  tenant_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  use_oidc  = true
}

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name        = "Test Project"
  description = "Test Project Description"
}
```

### Configure the provider to authenticate with the Terraform Cloud workload identity token with different plan & apply service principals

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azuredevops = {
      source  = "microsoft/azuredevops"
      version = ">=0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azuredevops" {
  org_service_url = "https://dev.azure.com/my-org"
  client_id_plan  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  client_id_apply = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  tenant_id_plan  = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  tenant_id_apply = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
  use_oidc        = true
}

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name        = "Test Project"
  description = "Test Project Description"
}
```
