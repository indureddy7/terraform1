# azuredevops_agent_queue

Manages an agent queue within Azure DevOps. In the UI, this is equivalent to adding an
Organization defined pool to a project.

The created queue is not authorized for use by all pipelines in the project. However,
the `azuredevops_resource_authorization` resource can be used to grant authorization.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azuredevops_project" "example" {
  name = "Example Project"
}

data "azuredevops_agent_pool" "example" {
  name = "example-pool"
}

resource "azuredevops_agent_queue" "example" {
  project_id    = azuredevops_project.example.id
  agent_pool_id = data.azuredevops_agent_pool.example.id
}

# Grant access to queue to all pipelines in the project
resource "azuredevops_resource_authorization" "example" {
  project_id  = azuredevops_project.example.id
  resource_id = azuredevops_agent_queue.example.id
  type        = "queue"
  authorized  = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project in which to create the resource.
- `agent_pool_id` - (Required) The ID of the organization agent pool.
